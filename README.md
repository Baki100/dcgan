# DCGAN

In this repository, you will find a demonstration of a Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) trained on the Fashion MNIST dataset. This project showcases the architectural differences from the GAN introduced in the first lab and highlights best practices for building this network.

## 📥 Download and Prepare the Dataset

You will use the [Fashion MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) dataset for this exercise. As before, you will need to create batches of the training images. The preprocessing steps are detailed below.

### Steps to follow:
1. **🔄 Load the dataset**: Download the Fashion MNIST dataset.
2. **🗂️ Create batches**: Organize the dataset into batches for training.
3. **🔧 Preprocess the data**: Apply necessary preprocessing steps to prepare the dataset for the DCGAN.
